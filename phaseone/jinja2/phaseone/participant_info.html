            <h2>Participant Information</h2>
            <p>We would like to invite you to take part in a research study. Before you decide whether you would like to take part it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. You will be given a copy of this information sheet to keep.</p>

            <h4>What is the purpose of the study?</h4>
            <p>Smartphones are really useful in making visual information accessible to visually impaired people. For instance, the SeeingAI app allows you to take a picture of your surroundings and then it reads aloud common things that are recognised in the picture, for example “a person sitting on a sofa”.</p>
            <p>The problem is that while these kinds of AI currently can say “this is a mug”, they can’t tell you which of your mugs is which, and they don’t know what a white cane is. We are trying to change this. We want these assistive technologies to work for you, so we are working with people like you to identify what things are important to your everyday life, and figure out how best to get the phone to recognise them.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the aim of this project is to create a large dataset of videos taken by visually impaired people. The videos will show things those people judge important in their lives and then the dataset will be used to train AI systems to recognise those things. We will be making an iPhone app to do this, so that we can involve hundreds or thousands of people. We need to get that app right though, so first we are observing how visually impaired people might use their phone for this.</p>
            
            <h4>Why have I been invited to take part?</h4>
            <p>You have been invited to participate in this study as an adult with a vision impairment living in the UK. You will be one of up to twelve people participating in the study.</p>
            
            <h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
            <p>Participation in the study is voluntary, and you can choose not to participate in part or all of the project. You can withdraw at any stage of the project without being penalised or disadvantaged in any way. If you decide to not take part in the study, your contact information and any data collected will be permanently deleted. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.  If you do decide to take part you will be asked to complete an online consent form. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without giving a reason.</p>
            
            <h4>What will happen if I take part? What do I have to do?</h4>
            <p>A researcher will visit you at your home during a prearranged date and time.  They will talk with you about what things you might like your phone to recognise, what you’re doing when you use them, and where it happens. This could be done with you and the researcher sitting around a table, or you might want us to follow you around as you find and show us the things, but please only take us to rooms in your home that you are happy for us to visit. As part of this, we will ask you to use the camera in your iPhone to capture five of these things. This will involve taking short videos (~10 seconds), and we will explore different techniques to do this. In total, you will make around 30 of these short videos. You will then send these videos from your phone to the researcher’s project phone. To do that, we will give you step-by-step instructions – we won't handle your phone or see what's in your photo library.</p>
            <p>This process will be filmed so that we can review what you’ve talked about and observe in detail any challenges you face capturing the things. We will also need the short videos you shot; the researcher will explain how to send these videos across to their device. The session will last for no more than two hours.</p>
            <p>Prior to the home visit you will also fill in a short demographic survey hosted online.</p>
            
            <h4>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h4>
            <p>This study is completely confidential, and we have identified no reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, safety, or side effects to you as a result of taking part in this study.  You may find it difficult to record the videos and share them with us. To reduce those risks, we will provide simple step-by-step instructions, and you can tell us at any point if it’s not working for you. A sighted researcher will be present to assist.</p>
            
            <h4>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h4>
            <p>Your participation in this research is appreciated and you will receive an incentive to the value of £50 in recognition for your input. We will also ensure you are one of the first to know when the final app is released to the App Store.</p>
            
            <h4>How is the project being funded?</h4>
            <p>The project is funded by Microsoft. We have an ‘AI for Accessibility grant’, see ‘Personalized object recognition through AI’ on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility-projects">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility-projects</a>.</p>

            <h4>What should I do if I want to take part?</h4>
            <p>If you would like to continue with the study, you will need to agree using our online consent form. If you have any questions, get in touch with Lida on the following email address <a href="mailto:***REMOVED***">***REMOVED***</a></p>
            <p>Once you have provided consent Lida will get in touch, initially via the email address you signed up with. She will ask you your preferred date and time to arrange the visit to your house.</p>
            
            <h4>Data privacy statement</h4>
            <p>***REMOVED*** the data controller of this study based in the United Kingdom. This means that we are responsible for looking after your information and using it properly. The legal basis under which your data will be processed is City’s public task.</p>
            <p>Your right to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in a specific way in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. To safeguard your rights, we will use the minimum personal-identifiable information possible (for further information please see guide to data protection).</p>
            <p>City will use your name and contact details to contact you about the research study as necessary. If you wish to receive the results of the study, your contact details will also be kept for this purpose. The only people who will have access to your identifiable information will be the project team, listed at <a href="https://orbit.city.ac.uk/team">https://orbit.city.ac.uk/team</a>. City will keep identifiable information about you from this study for 10 years after the study has finished.</p>
            <p>You can find out more about how City handles data by visiting <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/governance/legal">https://www.city.ac.uk/about/governance/legal</a>. If you are concerned about how we have processed your personal data, you can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office (IOC) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">https://ico.org.uk/</a>.</p>
            
            <h4>Will my taking part in the study be kept confidential?</h4>
            <p>Your participation will be kept confidential and we will take some precautions to guarantee your anonymity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your identity will be kept separate to the data collected for the study. The two will be tied with a randomly chosen participant number so people other than the research team will not be able to link your name with your data.</li>
                <li>Our aim is for any data collected for the study to not contain personally identifiable information. However there likely will be identifiable information in the data, for instance a glimpse of a face in one of our recordings or GPS metadata in the videos you shoot for us. Any data, including video, audio, photographs and quotes, that would enable you to be identified will be kept private to the research team and not shared with others or used as examples in any publications that we produce. We will only share and publish data and examples from which you cannot be identified.</li>
                <li>You can choose to allow us to use the data about you for subsequent publication, for example at conferences or written-up in papers. We will take care to excerpt and anonymise any data used in this manner.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What will happen to the results?</h4>
            <p>We will study the videos and explore their use with the AI technologies we are developing. Together, this will inform how we do the data collection for the main phase of this project. You’ll hopefully see this, for instance, in the design of the iPhone app we will develop.</p>
            <p>A summarised version of the findings of the study will be posted on the project website at orbit.city.ac.uk. Subsequent to the study, we may report our work, for example through publishing articles in academic journals or speaking at conferences. Anonymised and in the aggregate, all the data from the study may be provided as evidence for our conclusions. If we feel that concrete examples will help, we may chose to excerpt a short video sequence. The examples will not enable you to be identified as your face and voice will be obscured.</p>
            <p>If you desire to have a copy of the result, please send a request by email to the researcher.</p>
